    <p>My research project is to create an interactive map using the Twitter data and a NLP emotion classifier that could potentially be a useful tool for analyzing Chicago gang activity.</p>
    <p>The Twitter data used for the project is over 2 million tweets collected from members of a small gang in Chicago.</p>
    <p>The emotion classifier I use on my data is one created for the specific vernacular used by the gang members. It was developed by Terra Blevins.</p>
    <p>I will gather the data by parsing the tweets to filter the streets, blocks, and gang names mentioned in handles, tweet content, and retweets in the Chicago gang dataset. I will use a dictionary to cross reference blocks and street names in the area to be searched, which will be manually entered by the user of the program (i.e. 62, 39, Vernon). I will also create a dictionary of the known gangs in the area, and these will be searched for to. My program will create a new dictionary to associate each user with every place and gang mentioned. If a user retweets someone else’s tweet that contains a location, the location will be associated with the original tweeter. Then a “pin” representation of each tweet would be created, containing the location, handle, content, date created, and aggression/loss score generated by Terra’s emotion classifier. Potentially I could triangulate or average the locations to figure out where the user spends the most time.</p>
    <p>I will plot the pins or triangulations on an interactive map. The pins will be the color of the aggression/loss score (i.e. red for aggressive, blue for loss on a gradient scale). The map will be adjustable so that users can filter tweets by date and key phrase. Dates can also be filtered so the user could search for a specific event such as a death or birthday (i.e. “RIP Tyquan” or “HBD”). This would allow us insight into where people are talking about events that happen in the community, on a somewhat fine-grained scale.</p>
    <p>On the same map, I will plot neighborhood blight and arrests. The map will allow the user to toggle this data on and off. The user will be able to filter arrests by type (i.e. substance abuse, homicide). I will then see if my fellow researcher, Kevin Li of the statistics department, could potentially help me find some sort of correlation between the tweets and any of these variables.</p>
    <p>This tool would be specific to this dataset, as the tweets come from a very specific set of people and the vernacular of each gang in each city varies vastly. But, if given different a different set of tweets (with an adjusted NLP classifier), a new dictionary of relevant blocks/streets/gangs, and police data from the area, it could hopefully be applicable to more than one region or city.</p>
    <p>My goal for the project is to get an understanding of how computer science is used in academic research. I would love to create a useful and relevant tool, but I value the experience and learning process over any results I might find. However, it would be incredible if my final project is an accurate representation of my findings that is easy to use and robust.</p>

    <p>This is my weekly blog - check back for new posts each week!</p>

    <h4 style="background-color:darkgray;">Week 3</h4>
    <p>I started out this week by creating a very small test set of tweets to help with my parsing. I included tweets that contained relevant data about location and gang affiliation. I used this small set to start creating my parser, and continued to add tweets to make it more robust for testing.</p>
    <p>A very important thing I needed to consider, however, was how to organize my location data in terms of the best data structure to hold it all. I decided to create two lists: one containing all the users and information about locations and gangs mentioned, and another list of all locations mentioned and their tweet contents with aggression/loss score. I think this would allow me to create 2 maps and see which is more useful.</p>
    <p>A major decision I made is that, instead of creating a tool that attempts to locate Twitter users, I will make a tool that finds the most mentioned areas by a select group of users in order to generate a sort of “heat map”. This will allow someone to locate the areas in which the most “action” is happening.</p>
    <p>When analyzing the data from the CSV, I had to be very careful because the data is often corrupted if there is a comma in one of the fields, messing up the format. Thus I downloaded Excel, which allows me to create files that are separated by tabs instead of commas. Tabs are much less frequently used in Twitter data, so this should work better.</p>
    <p>I spent a lot of time parsing the data and organizing my python stripping code. I had to consider a lot of different tweet formats, such as retweets, emojis, and http links. It is requiring me to refresh the Python skills I learned 2 years ago and get back to the basics.</p>
    <p>My parser worked well on a tiny dataset of 5 tweets, successfully pulling out gang and location mentions, and associating information with the correct user (i.e. if its a retweet). I fine-tuned my parser by trying it on a bigger set. I think it has trouble when there are specific emojis, because I get a UTF-8 error. I plan on asking Elsbeth about that later.</p>
    <p>At our weekly meeting on Wednesday, each member of the group reported on their recent progress. I also met with Kevin, and it seems like he is going in a different direction than I am. Dr. McKeown is also mentoring another student, Alyssa, but her work is mostly on a separate project. I met with her a few times to help give ideas about data scraping (as I have experience with it), and she seems to be doing better with her project.</p>
    <p>Dr. McKeown was unable to meet with me during our usual Thursday meeting, so we spoke on the phone instead. She gave me the great idea of instead of using a mapping package for Python or some other complication visualization tool, I could just make a square grid, since the roads are essentially set up that way. This is what I plan on working on for the majority of next week. Hopefully the map leads to something insightful; we shall see.</p>

    <h4 style="background-color:darkgray;">Week 2</h4>
    <p>This week was spent mostly exploring the two potential projects to see what jumped out at me most. My plan was to create a potential project idea for each, and then decide which one at the end of the week when I meet with Dr. McKeown to discuss.</p>
    <p>For the gangster intervention project, I started reading through lots of tweets to get a sense of the dataset. I was having trouble seeing how location data could actually be found in the content. Thus I met with William Frey of the SAFE lab, which is Columbia’s space for investigating the online and offline behaviors of youths of color. He is also working on the gangster project and is familiar with the specific vernacular of the Chicago gang we are studying. He helped me look for patterns in the data, showing me what could allude to a person’s location and gang affiliation. I felt a little better about how I would approach the data. He showed me a somewhat outdated map of Chicago blocks coded by the minor gangs that exist block to block. This was helpful in giving me insight into how the gangs are organized. </p>
    <p>For the project, I will need to generate a map, so I read a few resources about plotting on Python maps to refresh my memory. I have done this some in computer science classes, but not in a while. I will later need to investigate how I will create an interactive map.</p>
    <p>Continuing my introductions to all of Dr. McKeown’s grad students, I spent some time talking to Jessica Ouyang about her work in NLP involving aligning sentences into a bigger paragraph. Her description was very technical and gave me a sense of what her research entails.</p>
    <p>This week I also met with Elsbeth Turcan (Dr. McKeown’s grad student working on the energy project) to get an idea of how I could help with that project. She told me 3 ideas of how I could do that: 1) modify some of the existing templates to make them more punchy or use alternative units (gallons of water, polar bears killed, etc). 2) I could modify the newspaper summarizer to create more attention-grabbing text. 3) I could get to know in depth the machine learning algorithms used to analyze text. I figured out how to run a test of the message sending program, which would be a big step in helping me get started if I chose this project.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday, I met with William again and attended a meeting about the gangster intervention project. At this point, I am beginning to feel more strongly about getting involved in this project, as I feel like it would give me more autonomy and feel like I’m doing my own project instead of making small changes to someone else’s. While the data is very messy and the project will be far from straight-forward, I am excited about its potential.</p>
    <p>I created a simply python script to make sure I was able to parse through a small subset of the Twitter data, and it seemed pretty simple to figure out. The major task will be creating a very detailed parser to create dictionaries and provide me with useful data.</p>
    <p>My approach to this would be testing on a small set of tweets (maybe 20) and seeing what data I could get, and at the end, applying it to the huge dataset of over 2 million.</p>
    <p>On Thursday I had a meeting with Dr. McKeown, and I presented a more detailed project proposal that would help guide me through the rest of the project. This can be seen in the research section of my website. I am excited about working on the gangster project and hope I am able to create an interesting and relevant tool. I feel much better going forward and am excited to see what the rest of the summer will lead to.</p>

    <h4 style="background-color:darkgray;">Week 1</h4>
    <p>Hi! Welcome to my weekly blog, where I will discuss and reflect on my participation in the DREU program over the course of the summer. I will post once per week, documenting my current work, conversations I have with other computer scientists, success and frustrations. I will also report on my exploration of the amazing New York City and detail my involvement in extracurricular activities. I hope you enjoy!</p>
    <p>I met with my mentor, Dr. Kathleen McKeown, at the beginning of the week to meet and discuss possible projects to get involved with. We also talked about my previous experience in computer science, and how I could get involved in a project that was challenging but feasible. Dr. McKeown was very welcoming and made me very excited to work under her group this summer. The two NLP projects she detailed in this initial meeting were: 
    <p>1) a study of energy use in Columbia apartments, involving generating personalized feedback based on usage data in order to alter energy consumption behaviors, and </p>
    <p>2) the analysis of gang activity via social media, in an attempt to predict and possibly prevent gang violence.</p>
    <p>Both of these projects greatly interest me. I feel like they both exemplify how natural language processing can be applied to real world data and create a positive world impact. One course I took sophomore year was Digital Studies, and this gave me a great introduction to computational tools that can be used for the analysis of texts. My meeting with Dr. McKeown gave me more insight into how NLP can be directly applied to address a major problem.
    <p>This week, Dr. McKeown instructed me to read several papers as well as meet with several people involved with these and other NLP projects. I met with Elsbeth Turcan, a grad student who is working on the energy project and Noura Farra, who is working on an NLP project involving less widely spoken languages. I also spoke on the phone with Fei-Tzin Lee, who is also working on the gang activity project. Each was very informative and helped me understand a little more about NLP and their roles as researchers.</p>
    <p>I also got to sit in on a meeting about the gang activity project. I listened to a data annotator give an update about the labeling of Twitter data and other aspects of the data processing. The meeting was held in the Northwest Corner Building of Columbia on the top floor, and the view was incredible! The photo at the top of this site comes from up there.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I met with Kevin Li, a Columbia undergrad working on the gang project. He is a statistics major and is also interested in getting involved. He showed me around the campus and took me to a spot where Columbia students often study and get coffee. I got to know him a bit and am excited to work more on this project alongside him.</p>
    <p>During this first week, I also explored online sources about machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing tools. One thing I found particularly interesting was a selection of papers that I read about the ethics of the use of big data. As data becomes increasingly available to us through users’ online presences, it is important to consider how its use can affect the people who stand behind the numbers and figures.</p> 
    <p>Towards the end of the week, I met again with Dr. McKeown about possible ways to get involved on both projects. For the gang intervention project, a possible task for me would be to sort through the tweets and look for any information about the location of the user (i.e. specific blocks, streets, schools in Chicago). Then, I would plot this on a map. I would also plot the amount of blight or empty buildings, as well as arrests related to substance abuse, and look for a correlation between the data.</p>
    <p>For the environment/energy project, I would likely work alongside Elsbeth and help with the templates or the new summarizer.</p>
    <p>I plan on spending some time over the weekend and during the beginning of next week exploring and researching about these possible projects to see what jumps out at me. </p>
    <p>The final thing I have worked on thus far is the creation of this website. I first considered using a site like Wordpress to host my site; but then, I decided instead to create my site from scratch. I have been wanting to practice and learn more HTML, and this seems like a prime opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading and check back next week for my next post!</p>
